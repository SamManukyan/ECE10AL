Foundations of Analog and Digital Circuits &amp; Systems Labs

- [x] Lab 1 - In the first laboratory, the goal was to familiarize ourselves with resistor operations. Then, we learned the characteristics and relationship between resistor voltage and resistorcurrent (Ohm’s law). 

- [x] Lab 2 -In the second laboratory, we explored various features of resistive networks. We calculated and measured voltage and current through various resistive networks. We also learned about input resistance.

- [x] Lab 3 -In the third laboratory, we worked on more complicated resistor networks to investigate series and parallel simplification of resistors. Additionally, we learned about a circuit called “voltage divider”, a potentiometer (pot), and the load effect. 

- [x] Lab 4 -This lab was intended to familiarize us with digital and analog signals, logic gates, and digital logic. The relationship between frequency and the number of inverters in a ring oscillator was also covered, as well as the relationship between Vin and Vout with different input signals, the characteristics of NAND and NOR gates, how to build and debug a 1-bit half adder using a circuit diagram, and the properties of NAND and NOR gates.

- [x] Lab 5 - This lab was intended to provide an introduction on how to convert digital to analog. It exposes us to multiple bit versions of DAC circuits mainly 2 bit,4 bit, and 8 bit. This lab is also intended to introduce us to the different wave forms produced by the DAC circuits, and how to calculate sine wave word sequences in decimal (to binary).

- [x] Lab 6 - The purpose of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with diodes and their nonlinear properties. We observed the current conduction and its ideal zero resistance, as well as current blockage and its ideal infinite resistance, by sweeping the input voltage values, measuring the voltage across the diode and resistor, as well as the diode current, and watching how it behaves before and after flipping.
